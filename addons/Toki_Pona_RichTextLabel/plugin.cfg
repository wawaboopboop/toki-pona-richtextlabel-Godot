name="Toki Pona RichTextLabel"
description="A custom RichTextLabel Node which translates toki pona words written in regular text (standard latin characters) into sitelen pona glyphs. The glyphs in the font used are mapped to characters which do not appear in toki pona text, so the translation turns each word into one of those characters, which then appears as the sitelen pona glyph from the font."
